- Export flow types for each built-in item renderer type
- Export a generic flow typed version of the renderer, `TypedViewRenderer`, that is designed to be extended to pass custom component flow types
  so the renderer typechecks custom components. See the [View Renderer documentation](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/core/navigation-next/docs/state-controllers#view-renderer) for more information.
