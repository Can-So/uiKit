- Type withAnalyticsEvents and withAnalyticsContext HOCs so that they do not lose flow types of the components they wrap when chained together. This will fix flow types not flowing through all of the components that we have instrumented with analytics as they are typically wrapped with both HOCs. We also now export AnalyticsContextWrappedComp and AnalyticsEventsWrappedComp parameterised types that allow you to explicitly type components wrapped with these HOCs which is necessary in cases where the HOC wrapping is abstracted within another function.
