- Minor changes - Learn more link is now a part of the FocusedTask props, so as to support links from both unified profile/id-org manager and structure of accessibleSites is now an array of string instead of the object. Bug fix - the index.ts is now in the correct place (under the src directory), the component couldn't be used earlier as the index file wasn't in the correct folder structure.
