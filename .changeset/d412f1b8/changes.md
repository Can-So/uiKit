- **Feature**: `components` prop now has an optional `container` entry that is wrapped around the header, body and footer. This provides compatibility for forms with fields in the body, and submit buttons in the footer
- **API changes:**
  - The `header`, `body` and `footer` props have been deprecated; such custom components should be passed within the `components` prop instead.
  - Custom `Body` components passed in using the new method must contain a `ref` element; this can be done using forwardRef, as seen in the `headerfooter` example.
  - Backwards compatibility has been maintained for this release; this change is not currently breaking
- **Documentation:** Examples have been updated to demonstrate the new container prop, as well as utilise the new composition method for custom header/body/footers.
