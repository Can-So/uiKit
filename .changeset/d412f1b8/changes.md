- - *Feature*: `components` prop now has an optional `container` entry that is wrapped around the header, body and footer. This provides compatibility for forms with fields in the body, and submit buttons in the footer \n - *API changes:* \n - The `header`, `body` and `footer` props have been deprecated; such custom components should be passed via the `components` prop instead. \n - Custom `Body` components passed in using the new method must contain a ‘ref’ element; this can be done using forwardRef, as seen in the ‘headerfooter’ example. \n -                 - Backwards compatibility has been maintained for this release; this change is not currently breaking
