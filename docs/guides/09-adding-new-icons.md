# Adding New Icons

!!IMPORTANT

The icons package has a custom build process, as it generates its both stripped
svgs and glyphs that are committed to the repo, so that they can be accessed as
paths when published.

Adding or updating a new icon:
* Add / update the icon under `packages/core/icon/utils/raw_svgs`
* Run `yarn update` from within the `packages/core/icon` directory

For detailed information, please refer to `packages/core/icon/README.md`.
