# Contributing

Although AtlasKit is responsible for the main development of their components, contributions from outside of our team account for a major part of our development. There's two types of contributions that we are capable of accepting:

1. Open source
2. Inter-team

We haven't had any major open source contributions yet, so we'll only focus on the inter-team contribution model for the time being.

## Inter-team contribution model

The inter-team contribution model is kept as light as possible, and is designed in a way to be compatible with what a theoretical open-source contribution model would look like. In the future, if we do end up fleshing out an open source model, it's preferable that we'd update the design of the inter-team model to be a superset of it in hopes that we'd be keeping it as slim, and effective as possible.

The steps for the inter-team model are as follows.

### Initial meeting

The contribution may be initially sparked by several methods:

- Water-cooler discussion with a colleague.
- Issue raised by another team.
- AtlasKit team member noticing similar implementations in products and raising it.

Whatever the method, there should be an initial meeting that is held. This helps to build empathy across teams and get everyone on the same page. The goal of this meeting is to:

1. Set initial action items for involved parties.
2. Decide who will be the contributor from the external team.
3. Decide who will be the shepherd from within the AtlasKit team.

Contributors are always from external teams, and shepherds are always from within the AtlasKit team.

### Sparring and design sign-off

After the initial meeting, there should be at least two action items which would be to:

1. Set up an architecture sparring between contributor and shepherd.
2. Start a discussion with design about the UX of the contribution.

Both actions may not require much work. For example, architecture sparring may not uncover any extra details that need to be fleshed out. It may be a simple carry over. Design sparring may be the same. Design may also want to change some interactions, or it may be that the component needs to be rethought in the context of being consumed by the rest of the company.

### Regular catch-ups

Since these two components can affect one another, everyone involved should keep in constant communication. Therefore it's a good idea if a regular catch-up is scheduled between interested parties to keep the feedback loop tight. These catchups may be simply stand-ups, or might be more involved and contain demos of work progress. The complexity of these will be unique for each contribution.

Some examples of this are:

- Daily stand-ups
- Weekly catch-ups
- Demos every other day

The key here is that everyone shares knowledge and can hold each other accountable as everyone may have several things on their plate at any given point in time.

### Shepherd involvement

Every contribution will have a shepherd, but to the extent at which this shepherd will be involved will vary. For example, a shepherd may not be a developer at all, or might decide that part-time development is a good idea. A shepherd may even take over development at some point. Whatever the case, the shepherd must at the very least be dedicated to:

- Reviewing relevant PRs
- Meeting with contributors, or involved parties
- Planning any foll ups after the final contribution and handover has been made.

Footnotes:

1. Component architecture sparring and design sparring / sign-off can happen async.
