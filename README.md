# AtlasKit MK II

This is a spike of the potential new build system to be shared by AtlasKit, Media and Fabric

## Getting started

First you'll need `pyarn` installed.

```
yarn global add pyarn
```

Now we can install the repo

```
pyarn install
```

You should now be able to run you normal commands

## Building

```
yarn run build
```

This will build all the tests for all the packages in the repo

# Testing

```
yarn run test
```

This will run jest for all the packages in the repo
