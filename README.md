Atlaskit is the technical implementation of the [Atlassian Design Guidelines][adg]. It is a collection of reusable components that can be downloaded independently into your projects. Each component is also independently versioned and published to npm.

The full list of components can be found in the [Atlaskit Registry][atlaskitregistry].

**This project is bound by a [Code of Conduct][codeofconduct].**

# Usage

#### Pre-requisites

It's strongly advised to use the Atlaskit CSS reset in your whole project, or some Atlaskit components
may diverge in appearance:

```javascript
import '@atlaskit/css-reset';
```

In general, you should avoid directly styling base elements (ex. p, h1, h2…) and uses classes instead.

#### Example for React projects

Atlaskit components are built for React. Here's an example of using the Avatar component:

1. First, you specify a component into your project as a dependency using npm: `npm install @atlaskit/avatar`
2. Then you can use it in your React projects like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Avatar from '@atlaskit/avatar';

export default (
  <Avatar
    src="https://design.atlassian.com/images/avatars/project-128.png"
    presence="online"
    size="large"
  />
);
```

Check out the [Atlaskit Registry][atlaskitregistry] to learn more.

#### Example for non-React projects

There is a subset of components available as styles called the Reduced UI pack.
To use:

1. You include these into your the HTML projects.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/@atlaskit/css-reset@latest" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/@atlaskit/reduced-ui-pack@latest" />
```

2. Then you can style HTML with

`<button class="ak-button ak-button__appearance-primary">Submit</button>`

Check out the [Reduced UI pack](http://go.atlassian.com/reduced-ui-pack) for more examples and details.

#### Upgrades

When upgrading an Atlaskit component, all changelogs can be found in the [Atlaskit Registry][atlaskitregistry].

# Installation

#### Before you start

* [node](https://nodejs.org/) version should be 6 or above (to check `node -v`) or use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version should be 3 or above (to check `npm --version`)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) should be installed globally (see yarn website for installation instructions)

#### Clone the repo and install

```sh
git clone git@bitbucket.org:atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2.git
yarn
```

You're now ready to start developing in Atlaskit!

Each component/util lives in it's own package under the `packages` directory. We are using [bolt](https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt) to manage our mono-repo, so you are going to need bolt installed globally as well.

```sh
yarn global add bolt
```

Next, to install packages, we use bolt, just calling it:

```sh
bolt
```
