  This flattens an array of Version objects into one object that can be used to create the changelogs
  and the publish commit messages.

  Dependents will be calculated and added to releases, then final versions will be calculated.

  It's output will look like

  {
    releases: [{
      name: 'package-a',
      version: '2.0.0',                // actual version being released

                                       // (used in changelogs)
      dependencies: ['package-c']      // list of dependencies that will need to be updated
