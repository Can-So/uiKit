# @atlaskit/editor-bitbucket

This component provides a packaged version of the Atlassian Editor for use in Bitbucket Cloud.

It's specific to Bitbucket Cloud in that it:

- has a schema that's compatible with Bitbucket's python-markdown
- provides *encoding to* python-markdown
- provides *decoding from* Bitbucket rendered HTML

## Try it out

Interact with a [live demo of the @atlaskit/editor-bitbucket component with code examples](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/stories/@atlaskit/editor-bitbucket/@VERSION@/).


## Installation

Install from NPM:

```sh
npm install @atlaskit/editor-bitbucket
```

Two flavours of JavaScript are published:

- ES5 (referenced by the `main` field in `package.json`)
- ES2015 (referenced by the `jsnext:main` field in `package.json`)

If you're using webpack, adjust your [`resolve.packageMains`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-packagemains) accordingly.


## Usage

The editor is built as a React component that can be used directly in a JSX file.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Editor from '@atlaskit/editor-bitbucket';

class Page extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Editor
          isExpandedByDefault
          onSave={this.handleSave}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }

  handleSave = (editor) => {
    alert(`Saved with python-markdown value: ${editor.value}`);
  }
}
```

Don't forget to add these polyfills to your product build if you're using emoji or mentions in the editor and you want to target older browsers:

 * Promise ([polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise), [browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises))
 * Fetch API ([polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whatwg-fetch), [browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch))
 * URLSearchParams API ([polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-search-params), [browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=urlsearchparams))
 * Element.closest ([polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/element-closest), [browser support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=element-closest))

## `Editor` API

```jsx
import Editor from '@atlaskit/editor-bitbucket';
```

### Props

#### `context?: 'comment' | 'pr'`

Adjusts the "context" of the editor. This affects the UI of the editor by making it appropriate
for the given situation.

#### `isExpandedByDefault?: boolean`

The initial "expanded" value. When the editor is expanded it can have content added by the user.
The non-expanded mode renders a small placeholder field that when focused, will switch to the expanded
mode.

#### `defaultValue?: string`

The initial value for the editor, in Bitbucket rendered HTML format.

#### `onCancel?: (editor?: Editor) => void`

A callback triggered when the cancel button is pressed. The cancel button is only rendered if this
prop is provided. Omitting this prop can be used to hide the button.

#### `onChange?: (editor?: Editor) => void`

A callback triggered when a content change is made.

#### `onSave?: (editor?: Editor) => void`

A callback triggered when the save button is pressed. The save button is only rendered if this
prop is provided. Omitting this prop can be used to hide the button.

#### `placeholder?: string`

A string to use in the non-expanded placeholder, e.g. `"What do you want to say?"`.

#### `imageUploadHandler?: ImageUploadHandler`

A handler for image uploads (e.g. when an image is pasted or dragged into the editor).

```typescript
type ImageUploadHandler = (e: any, insertImageFn: any) => void;
```


### Methods / setters / getters

#### `focus(): void`

Focuses the the editor.

#### `expand(): void`

Expands the the editor.

#### `collapse(): void`

Collapses the the editor.

#### `clear(): void`

Clears the content from the editor, returning it to an empty state.

#### `isEmpty(): boolean`

Returns true if the editor content is empty.

#### `setFromHtml(html: string): void`

Reset the editor's content by creating a new document based on the provided HTML. The HTML must be
in Bitbucket's rendered markdown HTML structure (e.g. from a pull request comment or description).

If the editor is not yet initialised (e.g. if it's still collapsed), calling this method will throw
an error.

#### `get value(): string | undefined`

Returns the value of the editor in python-markdown format. This getter computes the value
on request, as such only access this getter when the value is actually required.

#### `get doc(): Node | undefined`

Return the current ProseMirror document (if one exists).

#### `errorReporter?: ErrorReportingHandler`

If you're using some error reporting service/tool in your product you can help Atlassian Editor track and store its own errors inside your error reporting service. Provide "errorReporter" property to the Editor component and describe "captureMessage" and "captureException" methods for this.

```typescript
// if you're using Sentry
import * as Raven from 'raven';

// this is optional, use it only for TS support
import { ErrorReportingHandler, ErrorReporterTags } from '@atlaskit/editor-core';

Raven
  .config(DSN_URI, { release: RELEASE_VERSION })
  .install();

class ErrorReporter implements ErrorReportingHandler {
  captureMessage(msg: string, tags?: ErrorReporterTags) {
    Raven.captureMessage(msg, { ...tags, module: 'editor' });
  }

  captureException(err: Error, tags?: ErrorReporterTags) {
    Raven.captureException(err, { ...tags, module: 'editor' });
  }
}

const errorReporter = new ErrorReporter();

export default (
  <Editor errorReporter={errorReporter}/>
);
```
