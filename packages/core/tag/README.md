# Tag

This component is displayed as an accessible tag with an optional link and/or
button to remove it.

Although the `tag` component can be used by itself, it works best in
conjunction with the [`@findable/tag-group`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@findable/tag-group)
component.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @findable/tag
```

## Usage

Detailed docs and example usage can be found [here](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/core/tag).
