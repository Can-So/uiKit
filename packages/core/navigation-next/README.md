# Entrypoints

These are entrypoints for specific components to be used carefully by the consumers. If you're using one of these entrypoints we are assuming you know what you are doing. So it means that code-splitting and tree-shaking should be done on the consumer/product side.

## How to use it

```js
import LayoutManagerWithViewController from '@atlaskit/navigation-next/LayoutManagerWithViewController';
```

## Exposed entrypoints

- `atlaskit/navigation-next/LayoutManagerWithViewController`
- `atlaskit/navigation-next/ItemsRenderer`
- `atlaskit/navigation-next/SkeletonContainerView`
- `atlaskit/navigation-next/NavigationProvider`
- `atlaskit/navigation-next/AsyncLayoutManagerWithViewController`
- `atlaskit/navigation-next/GlobalNavigationSkeleton`
- `atlaskit/navigation-next/view-controller`
