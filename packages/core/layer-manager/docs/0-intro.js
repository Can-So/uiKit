  ## Why?
  The layer manager is used to render React DOM into a new context (aka "Portal").
  This can be used to implement various UI components such as modals.

  The impetus for creating this package was the constant war with z-indexes.
  When you wrap your app in a \`<LayerManager />\` it will create slots for each
  package that is supported, and portal each instance to the correct slot when
  rendered inside your react app.

  ## Usage
  Super simple to use, just wrap your app with the default export -- we'll listen
  to the context it broadcasts, and inject your components where they belong.

${code`
import LayerManager from '@atlaskit/layer-manager';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <LayerManager>
        ...
      </LayerManager>
    );
  }
}
`}

  ${(
    <Example
      Component={require('../examples/0-basic').default}
      source={require('!!raw-loader!../examples/0-basic')}
      title="Supported Components"
    />
  )}

  ## Focus Lock

  This component is used to trap focus inside an area of the screen. The main use
  case for this FocusLock component is to keep focus inside modal dialogs.

  ${(
    <Example
      Component={require('../examples/2-focus-lock').default}
      source={require('!!raw-loader!../examples/2-focus-lock')}
      title="Focus Lock"
    />
  )}

  ${(
    <Props
      heading="Focus Lock Props"
      props={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../src/components/FocusLock')}
    />
  )}

  ### Auto focusing an element

  There are a couple of options to focus an element that is not focused by default.
  The first is to use the autoFocus attribute on React dom elements. In the example below,
  'button one' is the default but 'button two' will have focus.

${code`
const App = () => (
  <FocusLock>
    <button>button one</button>
    <button autoFocus>button two</button>
  </FocusLock>
)
`}

  The other option is to attach a ref to the dom element and imperatively call \`focus()\`.
  This technique is described in [this section](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#adding-a-ref-to-a-dom-element)
  of the React documentation.

  ## Scroll Lock

  Component used to lock scroll positioning.

  ${(
    <React.Fragment>
      <Warning>
        <p>
          <strong>ScrollLock is deprecated.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please use{' '}
          <a href="https://github.com/jossmac/react-scrolllock">
            react-scrolllock
          </a>{' '}
          instead.
        </p>
      </Warning>
      <Example
        Component={require('../examples/1-scroll-lock').default}
        source={require('!!raw-loader!../examples/1-scroll-lock')}
        title="Scroll Lock - DEPRECATED"
      />
    </React.Fragment>
  )}

  ## Other Helpers

  There are a few patterns that are common among the supported packages, and have
  been abstracted into discrete components. While primarily for use internally,
  they're available as named exports from \`@atlaskit/layer-manager\`.

  ${(
    <Example
      Component={require('../examples/3-with-context').default}
      source={require('!!raw-loader!../examples/3-with-context')}
      title="With Context from Props"
    />
  )}

  ${(
    <Props
      props={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../src/components/LayerManager')}
    />
  )}
`;
