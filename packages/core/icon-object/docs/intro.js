This package includes the field-type icons. These are a subset of icons with the following unique attributes:

- They are represented at only 2 sizes, each size being a unique svg
    - a 16*16px icon
    - a 24*24px icon
- They do not have the sizing prop
- They have specific colours by default
- they have a different API to icons in the \`@atlaskit/icons\` package

### Using icons from \`@atlaskit/icon-object\`

${code`
import CodeIcon from '@atlaskit/icon-object/glyph/code/16';

const MyComponent = () => (
    <CodeIcon />
)
`}

If you want to use the CodeIcon at a different size, you would need
to import the 24px version of the icon as follows:

${code`
import CodeIcon from '@atlaskit/icon-object/glyph/code/24';

const MyComponent = () => (
    <CodeIcon />
)
`}

${<PitchSentence />}

${(
  <Example
    packageName="@atlaskit/icon-object"
    Component={require('../examples/icon-explorer').default}
    title="Icon Explorer"
    source={require('!!raw-loader!../examples/icon-explorer')}
  />
)}
`;
