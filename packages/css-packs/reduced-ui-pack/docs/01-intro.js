## Using Examples

The examples are written in react, however the rendered html code should be
copyable into your application, with the change of \`className\` to \`class\`.

If you want to see an example running using base html, you can see that use-case
in [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/8kj9x61yr9).

  The reduced UI pack is designed to allow you to use some ADG3 styling easily
  without opting in to using react. Instead, it provides a css file as its main
  export, allowing you to add classes and meta-properties to html to get
  styling.

  ## Pieces

  The Reduced UI pack sets you up for styling:

  * a css grid
  * form elements (including buttons)
  * icons

  ## Usage

  To use the reduced UI pack, you should also use our css reset. Both should be
  included in your project head like so:

  ~~~
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Your page</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@atlaskit/css-reset/dist/bundle.css" />
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@atlaskit/reduced-ui-pack/dist/bundle.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>Hello world!</p>
    </body>
  </html>
  ~~~

  With this, you can access classes to add all the styling you need.
